# 📺🤖✨ AGENTS.md ✨🤖📺

## THE ALL‑NEW, NEVER‑BEFORE‑SEEN, ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SOLUTION FOR

## **MINECRAFT BEDROCK ADDON MANAGEMENT**

*(Cue synth music. Neon grid background. A man points aggressively at the screen.)*

🎺🎺🎺 **HEY YOU. YES, YOU—THE BEDROCK SERVER ADMIN.** 🎺🎺🎺

Are you exhausted from addons that:

- ❌ Arrive in **whatever format the author felt like that day**
- ❌ Pretend there’s a “standard” (there is NOT)
- ❌ Mix Behavior Packs and Resource Packs like a blender set to *CHAOS*
- ❌ Explode your world because of one tiny UUID collision
- ❌ Require arcane JSON rituals just to ENABLE THEM

👉 **THEN STOP. PUT THE KEYBOARD DOWN.**

Because this repository introduces:

# 💥 AGENTS.md 💥

The **AI instruction file** that teaches your AI agent how to survive the absolute anarchy that is **Minecraft Bedrock addons**.

---

## 😱 THE SHOCKING TRUTH (THEY DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW)

Let’s say it loud for the people in the back:

> 🚨 **THERE IS NO STANDARD BEDROCK ADDON FORMAT.** 🚨

None.

Every creator ships something different:

* `.mcaddon` with BP + RP (sometimes)
* `.mcpack` with *one* pack (maybe)
* Zips renamed three times
* Nested folders inside nested folders inside regret
* Duplicate UUIDs reused across the internet
* Unicode symbols straight from a summoning circle

💥 This is not your fault.

💥 But until now… it WAS your problem.

---

## 🪄 ENTER: AGENTS.md (THE CONTROL PANEL)

`AGENTS.md` is a **rulebook for AI agents**.

You drop it into your Bedrock server directory and suddenly the AI:

= 🧠 Knows where packs go
= 🧠 Knows what it may touch
= 🧠 Knows what it must NEVER touch
= 🧠 Knows Bedrock’s weird rules better than most humans

= ✨ You don’t fix addon chaos anymore.
= ✨ You DELEGATE it.

---

## 🤖 WHAT THE AI CAN DO (NO, REALLY. THIS MUCH.)

When an AI agent reads **your actual AGENTS.md** (see below 👇), it can:

### 🧠 FORMAT DETECTION MADNESS

* Identify `.mcaddon`, `.mcpack`, renamed zips, and cursed archives
* Detect BP vs RP automatically
* Separate combined packs correctly
* Normalize inconsistent layouts

### 🧬 UUID APOCALYPSE PREVENTION

* Detect duplicate UUIDs *before Bedrock crashes*
* Regenerate UUIDs only when allowed
* Update references correctly
* Avoid touching vanilla server packs (AS COMMANDED)

### 📂 FOLDER SANITY RESTORATION

* Remove Unicode junk from folder names
* Flatten stupidly nested directories
* Enforce readable, predictable naming

### 📦 WORLD‑SAFE INSTALLATION

* Install packs into the correct directories
* Enable packs for worlds safely
* Prevent duplicate world entries
* Preserve production worlds like sacred artifacts

All because **you wrote the rules once**.

---

## 🧑‍💻✨ HOW DO YOU USE THIS?! (LIVE ON TV)

📺 *Camera zooms in. Host whispers.*

“It’s easier than you think.”

### 🛠️ STEP 1: INSTALL AN AI AGENT (YES, FREE MODELS)

You need an AI agent that can read files and follow instructions.

We recommend **OpenCode**:
👉 [https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

✅ Supports free models
✅ Local or remote
✅ Perfect for AGENTS.md workflows

No subscriptions.
No vendor lock‑in.
No rituals at midnight.

---

### 📂 STEP 2: DROP `AGENTS.md` INTO YOUR BEDROCK SERVER FOLDER

```
bedrock-server/
├── AGENTS.md        👈 THE BRAIN
├── mods/
├── behavior_packs/
├── resource_packs/
├── worlds/
└── bedrock_server
```

At this moment, the AI realizes:

🧠 **“Ah. This human does NOT want chaos.”**

---

### 📦 STEP 3: THROW ADDONS INTO `mods/` (ANY FORMAT, WE DARE YOU)

```
mods/
├── cool_mobs.mcaddon
├── weapons_pack.mcpack
├── random_discord_zip.zip
├── ✦ cursed_addon_FINAL_v7_REAL.zip
```

No standards?

GOOD.

That’s what the AI is for.

---

### 🪄 STEP 4: TYPE ONE SENTENCE

Open your AI agent in the server directory and say:

> **“I would like to enable all the addons in the folder `mods/`.”**

That’s it.

No scripts.
No guessing.
No JSON blood sacrifice.

---

## 🤖 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (AUTOMATICALLY)

The AI follows **your actual AGENTS.md rules**, including:

* Never touching vanilla packs
* Removing Unicode safely
* Detecting BP vs RP
* Extracting correctly
* Fixing conflicts
* Enabling packs per‑world

📣 It does EXACTLY what you told it to do.

---

## 📢📺 BUT WAIT — THERE’S MORE!!!

*(Crowd gasps. Host points dramatically.)*

This isn’t just a **one-way install machine**.

Because AGENTS.md gives the AI *context*, you can also:

🛠️ **Tell it what’s wrong**
🧹 **Tell it to remove addons**
🚫 **Tell it to disable packs**
🧠 **Tell it to FIX things — not guess**

### 🪄 YES, YOU CAN JUST SAY THINGS LIKE:

> **“Disable the Create Lite addon.”**

> **“Remove the broken minimap mod from all worlds.”**

> **“This addon crashes the server — find it and disable it safely.”**

> **“Re-enable everything except experimental packs.”**

Because the AI:

* Knows pack names
* Knows UUIDs
* Knows which worlds are using what
* Knows what it is allowed to touch
* Knows how to disable packs *without deleting them*

📣 You don’t hunt through JSON anymore.

📣 You ISSUE COMMANDS.

---

## 📂 docs/ — THE BORING (IMPORTANT) STUFF

This repo also includes a **`docs/` folder** for people who want:

* Less neon
* More clarity
* Fewer exclamation points

### `docs/overview.md`

A serious explanation of what AGENTS.md is and how AI agents should interpret it.

### `docs/bedrock-layout.md`

Canonical Bedrock server directory structure and why it matters.

### `docs/addon-detection.md`

Exact logic for BP vs RP detection, manifests, and edge cases.

### `docs/world-enabling.md`

How world pack JSON files work and how duplicates are prevented.

These docs are:

* Calm
* Precise
* Meant for humans **and** machines

The README sells the dream.

The docs explain reality.

---

## 📺 FINAL 80’S‑INFOMERCIAL PITCH

- 📣 STOP trusting random addon formats
- 📣 STOP hand‑editing JSON at 2 AM
- 📣 STOP sacrificing worlds to the UUID gods

- ✨ ADD AGENTS.md
- 🤖 TRAIN YOUR AI ONCE
- 🪄 WATCH CHAOS DISAPPEAR
- 🎮 GO BACK TO PLAYING MINECRAFT

---

### 🚨 WARNING

Using AGENTS.md may cause:

* Fewer broken servers
* Radical calm
* Over‑automation of unrelated tasks
* You explaining this to everyone else

---

**AGENTS.md**
*Because “Just Install the Addon” Was a Lie.*
