## THE MIRACLE SOLUTION FOR MINECRAFT BEDROCK ADDONS

*(As Seen In Late‑Night Terminal Sessions at 2:37 AM)*

🎺🎺🎺 **ATTENTION BEDROCK SERVER ADMINS!** 🎺🎺🎺

Are you tired of Minecraft Bedrock addons that…

- ❌ Come in **random, inconsistent formats**
- ❌ Mix Behavior Packs and Resource Packs like chaos incarnate
- ❌ Hide important files three folders deep for no reason
- ❌ Ship with broken or duplicated UUIDs
- ❌ Pretend there’s a “standard” when **THERE ISN’T ONE**
- ❌ Break your world if you so much as *enable them in the wrong order*

👉 **STOP THE MADNESS.**

Introducing **AGENTS.md** — a revolutionary, AI-powered addon management **instruction system** that brings **ORDER** to Bedrock addon chaos.

---

## 😱 THE DIRTY SECRET NOBODY TALKS ABOUT

Let’s say it out loud:

> **There is NO standard Bedrock addon pack format.**

None.
Zero.
Zilch.

Every addon author does something different:

* Some `.mcaddon` files contain *everything*
* Some ship **only** a Behavior Pack and forget the RP
* Some are nested five directories deep
* Some rename packs randomly
* Some reuse UUIDs (on purpose 🤦)
* Some almost work… until you combine them with literally anything else

💥 It’s the Wild West. With JSON.

## 🪄 THE MAGIC TRICK: AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is where **you teach an AI how to survive Bedrock addon chaos**.

It does **not** assume:

* A fixed folder structure ❌
* Correct naming ❌
* Valid UUIDs ❌
* Even basic sanity ❌

Instead, it tells AI:

✨ **“No matter what nonsense format this addon arrives in — figure it out.”** ✨

Like magic.
But deterministic.
And version‑controlled.

---

## 🤖 WHAT THE AI CAN DO (YES, REALLY)

When an AI agent reads `AGENTS.md`, it gains **Bedrock Addon Superpowers™**:

### 🧠 Format Detection Sorcery

* Automatically detects Behavior Packs vs Resource Packs
* Pairs BP ↔ RP even when authors didn’t
* Handles `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, renamed zips, nested archives, and cursed downloads

### 🧬 UUID Alchemy

* Detects UUID collisions *before Bedrock implodes*
* Regenerates UUIDs safely (only if allowed)
* Updates all cross‑references correctly
* No more Russian roulette with `manifest.json`

### 📂 Folder Chaos Normalization

* Flattens ridiculous directory layouts
* Fixes creators who packed their *entire home directory*
* Enforces a clean, predictable server structure

### 📦 Addon Installation Wizardry

* Installs packs into the **correct Bedrock directories**
* Links BP and RP pairs automatically
* Enables packs for the correct worlds
* Respects load order and dependencies

### 🛡️ World‑Saving Safety Protocols

* Knows which worlds are sacred
* Backs up before touching anything
* Refuses to destroy production unless explicitly told to

### 📢 No Silent Chaos

* Explains what it changed
* Documents decisions
* Leaves breadcrumbs instead of mystery damage

---

## 📜 WHAT IS AGENTS.md (IN HUMAN TERMS)?

It’s a **rulebook**.
A **contract**.
A **spellbook** (but in Markdown).

You define:

* Where addons live
* How worlds are structured
* What the AI **may** fix
* What the AI **must NEVER touch**
* How broken addons should be handled
* Whether magic is allowed or forbidden

The AI obeys. Relentlessly.

---

## 🧪 WHY THIS WORKS WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS

Other tools assume:

* Addons are well‑behaved ❌
* Creators followed guidelines ❌
* UUIDs are unique ❌
* Humans didn’t make mistakes ❌

**AGENTS.md assumes NONE OF THAT.**

It treats Bedrock addons as:

> “Untrusted artifacts from an unknowable universe”

Which, let’s be honest… they are.

## 🧑‍💻✨ HOW DO I USE THIS THING?! (ACTUAL SORCERY)

📺 *Cue the host dramatically walking into frame holding a laptop.*

“Okay, but how do I actually use it?”

### 🛠️ STEP 1: INSTALL AN AI AGENT (YES, FREE ONES EXIST)

You need an AI agent that can read files and follow instructions.
We recommend **OpenCode** — it supports **free models**, runs locally or remotely, and works beautifully with instruction files like `AGENTS.md`.

👉 [https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

No subscription.
No vendor lock‑in.
No dark rituals.

---

### 📂 STEP 2: DROP `AGENTS.md` INTO YOUR BEDROCK SERVER FOLDER

Place `AGENTS.md` at the root of your Bedrock Dedicated Server directory:

```
bedrock-server/
├── AGENTS.md        👈 THE BRAIN
├── worlds/
├── behavior_packs/
├── resource_packs/
├── mods/            👈 addon chaos lives here
├── bedrock_server
└── server.properties
```

This is the moment the AI realizes:

🧠 “Ah. This human has RULES.”

---

### 📦 STEP 3: THROW YOUR ADDONS INTO A FOLDER (ANY FORMAT, WE DARE YOU)

Drop your addons into something like:

```
mods/
├── cool_mobs.mcaddon
├── weapons_pack.mcpack
├── random_zip_from_discord.zip
├── cursed_addon_final_v3_REAL.zip
```

There is no standard format.

That is no longer *your* problem.

---

### 🪄 STEP 4: SAY THE MAGIC WORDS

Open your AI agent in the server directory and type:

> **“I would like to enable all the addons in the folder `mods/`.**”

That’s it.

No scripts.
No flags.
No manual UUID surgery.

---

### 🤖 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (WITHOUT YOU LIFTING A FINGER)

The AI:

✅ Scans the `mods/` folder
✅ Identifies addon formats automatically
✅ Extracts `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, zips, and cursed archives
✅ Determines BP vs RP
✅ Pairs packs correctly
✅ Detects and fixes UUID collisions
✅ Normalizes folder structure
✅ Installs packs correctly
✅ Enables them for the right worlds
✅ Follows *every rule you defined*

You watch it work.

## 📺 FINAL INFOMERCIAL PITCH

📣 Stop trusting random addon formats
📣 Stop hand‑editing JSON
📣 Stop sacrificing worlds to the UUID gods

✨ Add an `AGENTS.md`
🤖 Train your AI once
🪄 Turn chaos into order
🎮 Go back to actually playing Minecraft

---

### 🚨 WARNING

Using AGENTS.md may result in:

* Fewer broken worlds
* Reduced stress levels
* Dangerous confidence
* Automating everything else in your life

---

**AGENTS.md**
*Because “Just Install the Addon” Was a Lie.*
