# Contributing

First of all: thank you for even *considering* contributing. Bedrock addon management has hurt us all. You're among friends here.

This project is opinionated, intentional, and strict — **by design**.

---

## Core Philosophy

This project exists to:

* Impose order on Bedrock chaos
* Prevent world corruption
* Eliminate UUID roulette
* Stop humans (and AIs) from guessing

If a contribution undermines those goals, it will not be accepted.

---

## What You Can Contribute

We welcome:

* Documentation improvements
* New `docs/*.md` files
* Clarifications of Bedrock edge cases
* Better detection heuristics (clearly documented)
* Safety improvements

We are especially interested in **real-world broken addons** and how this system can handle them safely.

---

## What You Should NOT Contribute

Please do **not** submit:

* Code that auto-generates UUIDs
* Assumptions about addon structure
* “Best guesses” when metadata is missing
* Changes that weaken AGENTS.md authority

Bedrock has enough guesswork already.

---

## AGENTS.md Is Law

`AGENTS.md` is authoritative.

If:

* Your contribution conflicts with `AGENTS.md`
* Your contribution changes its meaning
* Your contribution bypasses its rules

It will be rejected.

If you think `AGENTS.md` is wrong, open a discussion **first**.

---

## Documentation Style

Docs should be:

* Clear
* Explicit
* Defensive
* Boring (seriously)

Humor belongs in the README, not the docs.

---

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a focused branch
3. Make small, explainable changes
4. Update or add documentation
5. Open a pull request with:

   * What problem this solves
   * Why it is safe
   * What it intentionally does NOT do

---

## Code of Conduct (Short Version)

* Be respectful
* Assume good intent
* Remember: Bedrock is the real villain here

Thanks for helping make Bedrock survivable.
